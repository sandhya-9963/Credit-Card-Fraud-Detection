# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Working Mechanism:
Data Preprocessing:

Load and clean transaction data, including features like transaction amount, time, and other anonymized metrics.
Handle missing values, normalize features, and split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Implement three machine learning models: KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.
Train each model on the training dataset.
Evaluation:

Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure their effectiveness in fraud detection.
Prediction:

Use the trained models to classify new transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
